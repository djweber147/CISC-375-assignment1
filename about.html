I am a senior in my 9th and final semester at St. Thomas. For the first two and a half years at St. Thomas, I was a memeber of St. John Vianney Seminary studying Philosophy and Catholic Studies. When I left the seminary, I decide to add a Computer Science major. I have loved studying this and can't wait to join the work force come December.

            <p>This website was created with an extensive number of highly complicated tools. Including, but not limited to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub. GitHub was used as the online repository and website hosting service. The HTML was brought to life with CSS and JavaScript. This site (specifically the photos page) contains Javascript animations and CSS transitions.
